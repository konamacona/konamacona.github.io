This was a side-project I decided to experiment with after reading [this blog post](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LaurentVictorino/20141202/231321/Mazes_hidden_beauty.php) by Laurent Victorino. It visualizes mazes by coloring each square based upon it's walk distance from an origin point.

I've made a lot of modifications on the original idea and added different types of animation to make some cool looking visualizations. Some day I'd like to add non-square based mazes and off-load the computation to web-workers.

I've recently updated it to work in the sidebar of this site!
