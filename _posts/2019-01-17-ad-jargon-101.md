I've been working on standing up a new ad stack for a site at work lately and wrote up a quick reference sheet to some of the terms I've been learning. I also presented these at our weekly tech-share meeting.

You can view the [slides pdf](https://github.com/konamacona/adJargon/raw/master/AdJargon.pdf), the [repo](https://github.com/konamacona/adJargon), or see below for it fluffed out into a blog post.
