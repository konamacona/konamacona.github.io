This was a side-project I decided to experiment with after reading [this blog post](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LaurentVictorino/20141202/231321/Mazes_hidden_beauty.php) by Laurent Victorino. It visualizes mazes by coloring each square based upon it's walk distance from an origin point.


This is still definitely a work in progress!
