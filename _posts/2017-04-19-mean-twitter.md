I decided to expand my knowledge of web technologies by diving into [Angular 2](https://angular.io/), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and creating a small twitter clone on a modified [MEAN Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)) (Modified because I used Angular 2).

This is still definitely a work in progress, I have a lot of features I'd like to add!
