I decided to expand my knowledge of web technologies by diving into [Angular 2](https://angular.io/), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and creating a small twitter clone on the [MEAN Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)).

## Planned Features

* ~~Login~~

* ~~View all Tweets~~
* Like
* ReTweet

## Known Issues:

* The logout button causes a page reload when running on Heroku.
* The menu button doesn't work on iOS when reaching the app through Heroku.

## Demo

This is still definitely a work in progress, I have a lot of features I'd like to add!
