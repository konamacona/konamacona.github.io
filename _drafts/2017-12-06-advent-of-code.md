![The partially completed 2017 aoc challenge]({{ site.url }}/public/images/aoc.png)

I am participating in [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/) which is a series of 25 programming challenges release in an advent calender format. This year I decided to write my solutions in [golang](https://golang.org/) as a way to learn some of the ins and outs of coding in go.

You can view [my solutions](https://github.com/konamacona/aoc2017) on github!
